This is a simple posting app
One Post form on the left that accepts two inputs a Title and a Description.
When you type in a title and description and hit post, the right side of the web page will get updated with a post.

STILL A WIP
TO DO: 
get axios working with a content/type: application/json.
get posts on right to update.
get styling corrected.

This app uses
Rails as the back end
PostgreSQL
React as front end

axios as the request handler
set up with sass as styling.
